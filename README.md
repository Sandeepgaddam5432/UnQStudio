## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to install two important pieces of software:

### Install Node.js

Node.js is required to run the application.

1. Visit the [Node.js Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version for your operating system
3. Run the installer, accepting the default settings
4. Verify Node.js is properly installed:
   - **For Windows Users**:
     1. Press `Windows + R`
     2. Type "sysdm.cpl" and press Enter
     3. Go to "Advanced" tab â†’ "Environment Variables"
     4. Check if `Node.js` appears in the "Path" variable
   - **For Mac/Linux Users**:
     1. Open Terminal
     2. Type this command:
        ```bash
        echo $PATH
        ```
     3. Look for `/usr/local/bin` in the output

## Running the Application

You have two options for running UnQStudio: directly on your machine or using Docker.

### Option 1: Direct Installation (Recommended for Beginners)

1. **Install Package Manager (pnpm)**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   
 

## Configuring API Keys and Providers

### Adding Your API Keys

Setting up your API keys in UnQStudio is straightforward:

1. Open the home page (main interface)
2. Select your desired provider from the dropdown menu
3. Click the pencil (edit) icon
4. Enter your API key in the secure input field

![API Key Configuration Interface](./docs/images/api-key-ui-section.png)

### Configuring Custom Base URLs

For providers that support custom base URLs (such as Ollama or LM Studio), follow these steps:

1. Click the settings icon in the sidebar to open the settings menu
   ![Settings Button Location](./docs/images/UnQStudio-settings-button.png)

2. Navigate to the "Providers" tab
3. Search for your provider using the search bar
4. Enter your custom base URL in the designated field
   ![Provider Base URL Configuration](./docs/images/provider-base-url.png)

> **Note**: Custom base URLs are particularly useful when running local instances of AI models or using custom API endpoints.

### Supported Providers

- Ollama
- LM Studio
- OpenAILike

## Setup Using Git (For Developers only)

This method is recommended for developers who want to:

- Contribute to the project
- Stay updated with the latest changes
- Switch between different versions
- Create custom modifications

#### Prerequisites

1. Install Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone -b stable https://github.com/Sandeepgaddam5432/UnQStudio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd UnQStudio
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. **(OPTIONAL)** Switch to the Main Branch if you want to use pre-release/testbranch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   pnpm install
   pnpm run dev
   ```
  Hint: Be aware that this can have beta-features and more likely got bugs than the stable release

>**Open the WebUI to test (Default: http://localhost:5173)**
>   - Beginngers: 
>     - Try to use a sophisticated Provider/Model like Anthropic with Claude Sonnet 3.x Models to get best results
>     - Explanation: The System Prompt currently implemented cant cover the best performance for all providers and models out there. So it works better with some models, then other, even if the models itself are perfect for programming
>     - Future: Planned is a Plugin/Extentions-Library so there can be different System Prompts for different Models, which will help to get better results

#### Staying Updated

To get the latest changes from the repository:

1. **Save Your Local Changes** (if any):

   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

2. **Pull Latest Updates**:

   ```bash
   git pull 
   ```

3. **Update Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Restore Your Local Changes** (if any):
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Git Setup

If you encounter issues:

1. **Clean Installation**:

   ```bash
   # Remove node modules and lock files
   rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml

   # Clear pnpm cache
   pnpm store prune

   # Reinstall dependencies
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Reset Local Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Discard all local changes
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

Remember to always commit your local changes or stash them before pulling updates to avoid conflicts.
